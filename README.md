# Text-To-Image-Generator


> This project uses the Stable Diffusion Pipeline to generate images from text prompts. The Stable Diffusion Pipeline is a machine learning model that uses a diffusion process to generate images from text prompts.
> This is a simple GUI application for generating images based on user prompts using the StableDiffusionPipeline model from the diffusers module. The application allows users to enter a prompt, click a button to generate an image based on the prompt, and view the generated image in the GUI window.

## function

When you run the code, you will be prompted to enter a text prompt. Once you have entered a text prompt, the Stable Diffusion Pipeline will generate an image based on the text prompt. The generated image will be displayed using matplotlib.
